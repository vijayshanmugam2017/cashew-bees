      Cashews are not just delicious but also a powerhouse of nutrition. They
      are rich in healthy fats, plant-based protein, and essential nutrients
      like magnesium, zinc, and vitamin E. Known to boost energy, improve heart
      health, and support brain function, cashews are a wholesome addition to
      any diet. Their antioxidants promote radiant skin, while their fiber
      content aids digestion.
